## Key TypeScript Concepts Explained Simply

### Differences between Interface and Type in TypeScript

Both `interface` and `type` can be used to describe the shape of an object in TypeScript, but they have some important differences.

Use `interface` when you're working with object structures. Interfaces are extendable using the `extends` keyword and can be declared multiple times. If you declare the same interface more than once, TypeScript will automatically merge them. This makes interfaces very useful for object-oriented programming patterns and class-based design.

Use `type` when you need to describe more complex type definitions. A `type` can represent not just objects, but also primitives, unions, intersections, tuples, and more. Unlike interfaces, type aliases are not mergeable. They are best suited for advanced type compositions where you're combining different kinds of types.

### Understanding keyof in TypeScript

The `keyof` keyword is used to extract all the keys of a given type and return them as a union of string literals. It is very useful when writing generic functions, because it ensures you're only working with valid property keys.

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type UserKeys = keyof User; // "id" | "name" | "email"
```

With `keyof`, TypeScript will throw an error if you try to access a property that doesn’t exist on the object. This prevents typos and helps you write safer code.

### The Difference Between any, unknown, and never

Understanding the difference between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` is important for writing safe and reliable TypeScript code.

The `any` type disables all type checking. You can assign anything to a variable typed as `any`, and TypeScript won’t complain. This is useful in some cases but can lead to bugs if overused.

```ts
let data: any = "Hello";
data = 42; // Allowed, but not type-safe
```

The `unknown` type is similar to `any`, but it forces you to perform type checking before using the value. This makes it a safer alternative to `any`.

```ts
let value: unknown = "Hello";

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
```

The `never` type is used for values that should never happen. For example, functions that always throw an error or never return can have the `never` type.

```ts
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error("This function never returns");
}
```

### Using Union and Intersection Types

TypeScript allows you to combine types using union (`|`) and intersection (`&`) operators.

A union type means a value can be one of several types. This is useful for flexibility when you expect different types of inputs.

```ts
type Status = "success" | "error";

function showMessage(status: Status) {
  if (status === "success") {
    console.log("Success!");
  }
}
```

An intersection type means a value must satisfy multiple types at once. This is useful when combining the features of multiple types into a single object.

```ts
type Admin = { role: string };
type User = { name: string };

type AdminUser = Admin & User;

const adminUser: AdminUser = {
  role: "moderator",
  name: "Parves"
};
```

Use union types when a variable can be one of many types. Use intersection types when an object needs to satisfy multiple requirements.

### Some Common TypeScript Commands

Here are some helpful TypeScript commands you’ll use often in real-world projects:
tsc --init
Initializes a `tsconfig.json` file for configuring your TypeScript project.
In `tsconfig.json`, you can set the target version like this
"target": "es2016"
ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only server.ts
